## Description
In todayâ€™s information-rich virtual world, students and pupils have difficulty to learn effectively and concentrate over time.
learnow helps in tracking the level of attention and the level of meditation during the learning process while trying to improve these metrics and make the learning process more efficient.
learnow is a system that monitors the user's brain activity during learning activities using sensors. The system analyzes the brain activity data and recommends to the user to do a learning break activity that may increase the level of attention and the level of meditation. After performing a break from learning activity, the user will perform a re-learning activity and the system will show the extent of the effect of the break from learning activity on raising the level of attention and meditation.
The system processes the impact measures of each break from learning activity for each user and will present the activities that contribute most to improving the learning process for him.
